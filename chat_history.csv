waht is the formula of gradint decent," The basic formula for gradient descent, a common optimization algorithm used in machine learning, is as follows:

w = w - α * grad(L)(w)

Here's what each symbol represents:
- w refers to the weight or parameters being updated.
- α (alpha) is the learning rate, which controls the step size taken during each update.
- grad(L)(w) is the gradient of the loss function L with respect to w. This tells us the direction and magnitude of the error in our prediction for a given weight, allowing us to adjust the weights in the correct direction to minimize the loss."
